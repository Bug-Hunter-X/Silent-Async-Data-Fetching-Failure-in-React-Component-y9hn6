# Silent Async Data Fetching Failure in React Component

This repository demonstrates a common but subtle bug in React components that handle asynchronous data fetching.  The bug involves a missing cleanup function in the `useEffect` hook, leading to silent failures when fetching data fails.

## The Bug

The provided `bug.js` file shows a React component that fetches data from an API.  The error handling is incomplete.  In particular, no cleanup function is included in the useEffect hook which leads to problems if the component is unmounted before the fetch request completes.  Additionally, there is a potential issue with a stale closure if the `fetchData` function is not properly defined.  The finally block might not solve issues, if the error handling is not in place.

## The Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the corrected component.  It includes proper error handling and a cleanup function in the `useEffect` hook to prevent memory leaks and unexpected behavior.  The solution ensures robust handling of network errors and data processing failures.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies (if any are needed).
3. Examine and run both `bug.js` and `bugSolution.js` to observe the different behaviors when the fetch request fails or the component is unmounted prematurely.
